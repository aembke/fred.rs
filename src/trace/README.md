Tracing
=======

Tracing is implemented via the [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) crate. This page describes the spans used by the client and the fields emitted on each of the spans.

See the [pipeline test](../../bin/pipeline_test) application for an example showing how to configure tracing with a local Jaeger instance. This crate ships with a [small example](../../tests/docker/compose/jaeger.yml) that uses `docker-compose` to run a local Jaeger instance.

## Spans

This table shows the spans emitted by the client. The `Partial Trace` column describes whether the span will appear when only the `partial-tracing` feature flag is enabled.

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                             | Partial Trace |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| redis_command     | The top level span used for all redis commands.                                                                                                         | x             |
| prepare_args      | Time spent checking and preparing arguments.                                                                                                            |               |
| queued            | Time spent waiting in the in-memory queue before being sent to the server. Pipelining and backpressure settings can drastically affect this.            |               |
| write_command     | Time spent routing and writing a command.                                                                                                               |               |
| wait_for_response | Time spent waiting on a response from the server, starting from when the first byte is fed to the socket and ending when the response has been decoded. | x             |
| parse_pubsub      | Time spent parsing a publish-subscribe message.                                                                                                         |               |

Tracing levels for the two tracing features can be configured separately through the `TracingConfig`.

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| backpressure            | Emitted when a command hits backpressure due to too many in-flight commands.  |
