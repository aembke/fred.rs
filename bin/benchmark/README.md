Fred Benchmark
=============

Redis includes a [benchmarking tool](https://redis.io/docs/management/optimization/benchmarks/) that can be used to measure the throughput of a client/connection pool. This module attempts to reproduce the same process with Tokio and Fred. 

The general strategy involves using an atomic global counter and spawning `-c` Tokio tasks that fight over `-P` clients in order to send `-n` total `INCR` commands to the server as quickly as possible.

Each of the `-c` Tokio tasks use a different random key so commands are uniformly distributed across a cluster or replica set.

This strategy also has the benefit of being somewhat representative of an Axum or Actix web server use case where requests run in separate Tokio tasks but share a common client pool. 

## Tuning

`fred` supports several additional features or performance tuning options that can affect these results. For example:

* Tracing. Simply enabling the FF cut throughput by ~20% in my tests.
* Pipelining. The `auto_pipeline` feature can dramatically improve throughput in scenarios like this where a client or pool is shared among many Tokio tasks.
* Clustering
* Backpressure settings
* Network latency
* Log levels, often indirectly for the same reason as `tracing` (contention on a pipe, file handle, or socket).
* The size of the client connection pool.
* And much more...

Callers should take care to consider each of these when deciding on argv values.

This module also includes an optional `assert-expected` feature flag that adds an `assert!` call after each `INCR` command to ensure the response is actually correct. 

## Tracing 

**This part frequently breaks since I rarely use tracing while benchmarking.**

This also shows how to configure the client with tracing enabled against a local Jaeger instance. A [docker compose](../../tests/docker/compose/jaeger.yml) file is included that will run a local Jaeger instance.

```
docker-compose -f /path/to/fred/tests/docker/compose/jaeger.yml up
```

Then navigate to <http://localhost:16686>.

By default, this module does not compile any tracing features, but there are 3 flags that can toggle how tracing is configured.

* `partial-tracing` - Enables `fred/partial-tracing` and emits traces to the local jaeger instance.
* `full-tracing` - Enables `fred/full-tracing` and emits traces to the local jaeger instance.
* `stdout-tracing` - Enables `fred/partial-tracing` and emits traces to stdout.

## Docker

Linux+Docker is the best supported option via the `./run.sh` script. The `Cargo.toml` provided here has a comment/toggle around the lines that need to change if callers want to use a remote server. 

Callers may have to also change `run.sh` to enable additional features in docker.

**I would not even bother trying to run this on OS X, especially on Apple Silicon, with Docker at the moment.** It will be very slow compared to Linux or any other deployment model that avoids an Apple FS virtualization layer. All the docker tooling assumes a local docker engine and makes frequent use of `VOLUME`s.

## `redis-rs` Comparison

The `USE_REDIS_RS` environment variable can be toggled to [switch the benchmark logic](./src/_redis.rs) to use `redis-rs` instead of `fred`. There's also an `info` level log line that can confirm this at runtime. 

The `redis-rs` variant uses the same general strategy, but with [bb8-redis](https://crates.io/crates/bb8-redis) (specifically `Pool<RedisMultiplexedConnectionManager>`) instead of `fred::clients::RedisPool`. All the other more structural components in the benchmark logic are the same. 

Please reach out if you think this tooling or strategy is not representative of a real-world Tokio-based use case. 

### Background

First, I'd recommend reading this: https://redis.io/docs/manual/pipelining. It's important to understand what RTT is, why pipelining minimizes its impact in general, and why it's often the only thing that really matters for the overall throughput of an IO-bound application with dependencies like Redis.

In the past I've avoided directly comparing `fred` and `redis-rs` because in my opinion they're just built for different use cases. However, recently Rust has become more popular in the web development space, specifically with Axum, Actix, or other Tokio-based web frameworks, and I've received some requests for a more detailed comparison of the two in this context.

These use cases often share an important characteristic:

End-user requests run concurrently, often in parallel in separate Tokio tasks, but need to share a small pool of Redis connections via some kind of dependency injection interface. These request tasks rarely have any kind of synchronization requirements (there's usually no reason one user's request should have to wait for another to finish), so ideally we could efficiently interleave their Redis commands on the wire in a way that can take advantage of this. 

For example,

1. Task A writes command 1 to server.
2. Task B writes command 2 to server.
3. Task A reads command response 1 from server.
4. Task B reads command response 2 from server.

reduces the impact of RTT much more effectively than

1. Task A writes command 1 to server.
2. Task A reads command response 1 from server.
3. Task B writes command 2 to server.
4. Task B reads command response 2 from server.

and the effect becomes even more pronounced as concurrency (the number of tasks) increases, at least until other bottlenecks kick in. You'll often see me describe this as "pipelining across tasks", whereas the `redis::Pipeline` and `fred::clients::Pipeline` interfaces control pipelining __within__ a task.

This benchmarking tool is built specifically to represent this class of high concurrency use cases and to measure the impact of this particular pipelining optimization (`auto_pipeline: true` in `fred`), so it seemed interesting to adapt it to compare the two libraries. If this pipelining strategy is really that effective then we should see `fred` perform roughly the same as `redis-rs` when `auto_pipeline: false`, but it should outperform when `auto_pipeline: true`.

If your use case is not structured this way or your stack does not use Tokio concurrency features then these results are likely less relevant.
